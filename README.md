Description: Our site features a to-do list which allows you to not only add tasks, but to also sort your tasks into categories. You'll need a username and password to log in, and if you don't have one, an account will be created for you when you log in. You can also choose to see your completed or uncompleted tasks. You can also move completed tasks back to your active tasks, in addition to editing and deleting your tasks. We've added a search function where you can see other people's to-do lists, which you don't necessarily have to be logged in to see.

Features: 
1) Choose which tasks you've completed and haven't completed yet
2) Choose a specific category to create a to-do list in
